    <div class="grid-item-title">My Ten Precepts<div class="grid-item">

      If you had to distill all the valuable lessons you have learned down to ten precepts what would they be? Here are my ten:
    <ol>

      <li>Seek happiness above all
      
    <br><br></li><dt> This doesn't mean you should only think short time, but rather to optimize for overall happiness. Likewise it doesn't mean to only seek self happiness but rather general happiness. One other distinction to be made is the difference between seeking and craving. Let happiness be your north star, but not your entire sky. Don't crave the world to change to make you happy but rather learn to be happy in spite of what the world is like. You have little control of the world, so asking for the world to change is asking for misery. Whenever you do get to make decisions about your life, seek long term, general, happiness above all.
      
    <br><br></dt><li>Hard work isn't always rewarded but it is often rewarding
      
    <br><br></li><dt>Many times going above and beyond won't get you recognized. Many times you aren't incentivized to do more than the minimum. However going 105% still teaches you to go 105% and may be useful in the future. Going at 105% is also way more satisfying than going at 75%. Note that this precept doesn't only apply to work. If you are socializing, do so as hard as you can. Relax as hard as you can when it is time to relax. Exercise as hard as you can during gym time. Pouring all your energy into your next goal is insanely satisfying when you reach said goal.
      
    <br><br></dt><li>Improvement isn't noticeable day to day but can't be ignored year to year
      
    <br><br></li><dt>If you go to the gym one day and quit you will hardly gain any strength. But a consistent habit of going to the gym will make you stronger. In life all things compound. Just how savings see exponential growth in the future, so do your friendships, career goals, and health. Plant those seeds now and continue to water them even though you can't see the plants grow as you stare at them.
      
    <br><br></dt><li>There is always a logical explanation even if it is unknowable or seemingly illogical
      
    <br><br></li><dt>This precept sort of goes along with the next one. Oftentimes people will make decisions that seem dumb or illogical. No one would purposely make a decision they think is the worst of the two options, but they might evaluate or see things differently than others. This precept also applies more abstractly. There are many very important questions that are currently unknown or uncertain. We don't know with certainty why there is a universe. It gives me comfort to know there is an answer to these questions, even if I don't know it yet or if I may never be able to know the answer. This precept means we should seek truth and logic, and drive for truth and logic to questions we don't know or don't think the answer is logical.
      
    <br><br></dt><li>No person is fundamentally evil, but many define good differently than you do
      
    <br><br></li><dt>This precept may be controversial but I believe all people are fundamentally good. It is easy to accept when people return lost wallets and donate time to charity, but hard to see fundamental goodness in those who pickpocket or murder. These sorts of crime may have good motivations (“I will steal to feed my family” or “I will murder to protect my country in this war”) or often are moments of rage and lack of thinking (“That gold necklace looks sweet!” or “oh shit I was so angry I didn't actually want to kill them”). Other times “evil” acts may be done by people who don't see their actions as evil, whether due to different sets of morales or mental illness or otherwise. The later part of this precept is especially important in discussions surrounding politics. It is useful to view someone on the opposite side of the political spectrum as a good person with different sets of morals. Even if their belief seems illogical, there is a logical explanation behind it. At most view them as “misguided” or “ignorant” rather than evil (although in my opinion that in itself is a very narrow and ignorant world view to hold).
      
    <br><br></dt><li>Optimize for the long term, but enjoy the short term
      
    <br><br></li><dt>This precept is probably the easiest to understand, but also the hardest to balance. If you were trying to optimize, say, your financial situation how might you do so? Most people would say you should invest in stocks and save as much of your income you can for retirement. Taking this to the extreme, one might live in their car and only eat rice while saving the rest of their salary towards long term wealth. On the other hand of the spectrum, one could go into large amounts of debt to drive a Porsche they can't afford and eat at fogo de chao everyday. In practice there is clearly a balance to enjoy the short term pleasures life has, while setting yourself up for long term success and happiness as well. Personal finance is of course just one application of this precept, which can be applied universally across the important things in life. Most people who know me would say I err on the side of “optimizing for the long term”, however, I  really do enjoy the short term and don't think I would be any happier seeking out short term. Skipping a day in the gym or purchasing whatever new trinket really isn't that appealing to me because I enjoy gym and have been plenty happy without the trinket thus far.
      
    <br><br></dt><li>Take risks that you perceive to be dangerous, but avoid risks that are actually dangerous
      
    <br><br></li><dt>Often things that are “scary” aren't all that dangerous, and things that seem innocuous are quite dangerous. Posting this blog post is a risk. My manager (hi Wendy) could read this and think negatively about me due to the inclusion or absence of one of these precepts. Before I published my book, or started this blog I certainly felt there could be a real risk to doing so. However, I rationalized it by realizing the actual risk was quite small. On the other hand, I occasionally indulge in ice cream, chips, or alcohol without having enough fear over the heart disease and obesity risks routine consumption of these foods are associated with. Humans are notoriously bad about perceiving risk accurately. There is a famous study where people are asked to give a dollar, flip a coin, and if the coin is heads they would get back $5. A shockingly high percentage of people don't agree to the coin flip because they perceive the risk of losing the dollar to be too high even though on expectation they are set to gain money. People are afraid to hop on a roller coaster even though the drive to the theme park was far more lethal. Just this weekend I talked to someone who was hesitant to take a promotion where the actual risk would be a conversation with their manager to have the old job back again. Taking risks is incredibly important to maximize enjoyment and interesting experiences. The practical advice when faced with a risk is to ask “what is the actual likelihood and consequence if something goes awry”, and making a rational assessment based on logic rather than fear.
      
    <br><br></dt><li>Long term relationship are more important than winning short term disagreements
      
    <br><br></li><dt>This precept does not mean to always be a pushover. It does not mean to always “placate” people when opinions clash to preserve the relationship. What this does mean is to realize there is no use burning bridges over something stupid. There is no reason to damage relationships by acting out of spite or by taking disagreements too far. Likewise, you should be open to forgiveness if someone else takes a disagreement out of its context. There are times where being a pushover is actually the best strategy one can use in an argument. I've always been of the opinion during a minor disagreement or scuffle that I am open to taking the blame, or to swallowing my pride and not escalating. It costs you nothing to assume blame and apologize, even if you don't think you are at fault. There is really nothing to be lost from “losing” an argument. If two mutual friends have a disagreement over a few dollars or doing the dishes I am happy to pay or do the work to avoid things escalating. Oftentimes the argument isn't actually about the $3 or the 2 minutes of work but something deeper. If you are spending more time arguing than just doing the work, consider swallowing your pride and doing the work regardless if you are “in the right”. Relationships are too important to damage over something stupid.
      
    <br><br></dt><li>You are your body. Take care of it.
      
    <br><br></li><dt>You only get one body, and its health or demise is your health or demise. Take care of it, because it's the best investment you can make. Quit smoking or drugs. Get in good shape. Exercise regularly. Lift weights. Train intervals. Eat healthily. Consume a balanced diet rich in nutrients and unprocessed foods. Stay hydrated. Have good hygiene. Get enough quality sleep. Challenge yourself at work. Stimulate your brain with a book. Cut screen usage. Wear sunscreen. Develop long lasting, genuine relationships. Meditate.
      
    <br><br></dt><li>Deviate from all rules when it makes sense
      
    <br><br></li><dt>I am not there to police any of these precepts or say how you should live your life. There may be times when the best thing for you is to break one of these precepts. Likewise, there are times where practicing civil disobedience is the most ethical thing you can do. Generally rules and laws are designed to keep people safe, but this isn't universally true. The law shouldn't confine you when it is clearly immoral and wrong, but you should be very sure it is both immoral and wrong before deviating from said laws. Accept any consequences that may result. Ultimately only you are in control of yourself and your own life. Do what is optimal, not what the law or my other 9 precepts say.
