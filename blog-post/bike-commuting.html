    <div class="grid-item-title">Bike Commuting: You don’t have a good excuse<div class="grid-item">
     
		    My workday mornings start a little bit differently than most Americans. While I wake up to an alarm and brush my teeth for work, I don’t hop in a car, but rather hop onto my bike. Biking to work is one of the most enjoyable parts of my day. It is an hour each way of solace amidst the hectic work we live in. It is an hour for my brain to wake up prior to the mental demands and stress that await me at work. It is an hour of my brain becoming an endorphin factory. Having biked to work across a number of different jobs and homes, I want to first make the argument that your commute is in fact bikeable, and then give practical tips for anyone interested in trying bike commuting.<br><br>

Excuse 1: It is too dangerous<br><br>

This is the most common excuse I hear for people scared to bike to work. Consider an alternative route rather than the big roads. Don't be afraid to add some miles on side streets to increase safety of your route. I think most people might be shocked how bikeable their commutes are as long as you put in the effort to find the ideal route. As of writing this I bike commute in Los Angeles, one of the car meccas of the world. My commute includes a brief stint on a 8 lane really nasty road with semi truck traffic. I have been bike commuting for years along with cars and have never been hit. I think biking is far safer than most people realize. I have found if you assert yourself in the right lane cars will not divebomb you. That being said, defensive biking is a must. Don't be afraid to take the sidewalk where needed. Cars expect bikes to roll through stop signs so keep true to their expectations.<br><br>

Excuse 2: I live too far<br><br>

Where you live is completely under your control, so you can move closer to work. Many people don't realize how fast biking is when you aren't stuck in traffic. For my current commute, I live 14 miles away which is 35 minutes or so in LA traffic. To bike, it takes me 70 minutes. However, when I am biking it also means I don't need to go to the gym after work to bike. I am effectively getting 140 minutes of exercise and beach sun in 70 minutes of time, given I would need to drive to work anyways. Plus that time is enjoyable instead of miserable stop and go traffic. If you live within 14 miles from work there is no way you are actually too far to bike every day. You will develop strong legs within a few weeks, which can reduce that time quite a bit by pedaling harder. Even if it seems like a lot of time, you could just bike once or twice a week (although I promise you will get hooked). If that amount of time still seems like a hard sell, or you live even further away, consider getting an ebike which can reduce the time commitment.<br><br>
 

Excuse 3: I will smell<br><br>

Many workplaces actually have a shower! Ask around. Otherwise you can join a gym nearby work and shower at the gym. If there are no showers nearby, just take it easy or get an ebike so you don't sweat. With a little deodorant and a change of clothes no one will be able to tell.<br><br>

Excuse 4: It is raining<br><br>


While LA rarely rains, I still bike to work when it does. Those are some of my favorite days given you feel like a child just getting absolutely drenched. Difficult circumstances build character. Plus it's just fun. You will shower when you get to work so go for it.<br><br>


Excuse 5: It is too dark and I work at night<br><br>

They sell headlights/taillights and other flashing lights for bikes. Get a few lights and put on your highest visibility shirt and you will be fine.<br><br>

Excuse 5: I don't know where to get started<br><br>

If you don't have a bike, buy one! Your gas savings will pay for the bike very fast. If you already have a bike this is trivial. Look at the satellite view between your place and work, and plan out the safest route that you can find. From there I recommend dry running the route on a day you don't have work. This way you can experiment with alternative streets as you please and don't have the stress of getting to work on time. After your dry run, give yourself plenty of time the first day and just ride on! It can take a few days to learn your route, but once you do it's so fun to relieve stress, get some sun and get that exercise in before work. A few bike upgrades that might be worthwhile once you are hooked are lights to unlock 24/7 riding, and panniers to hold tools and your work clothes. I recommend getting a spare inner tube and a chain tool should your bike give any difficulties. Bike maintenance is quite intuitive and easy to learn. See you on the streets!
