    <div class="grid-item-title">About Us<div class="grid-item">
        Vitez Engineering was founded to reduce cost and risk associated with developing and flying GNC algorithms. We are working toward a future where GNC flight software is low cost, low risk, 
        and turnkey by developing GNC algorithms and models that are highly extensible to any form factor of satellite. From GEO sat to nanosat, our product simply works out of the box to meet ADCS and GNC system performance requirements, 
        or help define requirements with high fidelity simulations.
