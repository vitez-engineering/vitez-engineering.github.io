        Vitez Engineering was founded to reduce cost and risk associated with developing and flying GNC algorithms. We are
        working toward a future where GNC flight software and simulation is plug and play by developing GNC
        algorithms and models that are highly extensible to any form factor of satellite or vehicle. From GEO sat
        to nanosat, our tools simply works out of the box to meet ADCS and GNC system performance requirements.

                        Vitez Engineering provides flight software that simply works right away, with all the GNC capabilities to fly your mission. With access to ultra high fidelity satellite simulations from day zero, we make component sizing and selection a piece of cake.
                        Our simulations offer ultra high fidelity models of the entire space domain. Accurate simulation is an integral part of mission success, which is why our simulation suite is rigorously tested to the same standard as our flight software.
