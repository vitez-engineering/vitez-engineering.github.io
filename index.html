      <div class="grid-item">

        Vitez Engineering provides flight
        software that simply works right away, with all the GNC capabilities to fly your mission. Our algorithms are rigorously developed, tested, and tested again
        to ensure your mission is a success. Our controller gains are automatically tuned to your exact satellite 
        parameters to ensure a robust, accurate, and swift control response. Don't have a satellite yet? 
        You can use our proprietary simulation suite to run trade studies on components and optimize your satellite from day zero.

      High Fidelity, Fast Simulation
      <div class="grid-item-tagline">We take care of the nitty-gritty details so that you don't have to</div>

      <div class="grid-item">

        Our simulations offer ultra high fidelity models of the entire space domain.
        Accurate simulation is an integral part of mission success, which is why our simulation suite is rigorously tested to the same standard as our 
        flight software.
        
        <br><br>
        Our simulation and flight algorithms are written in Julia to enable blazing-fast performance. From monte carlos to trade studies, you can simulate thousands of flights over the entire lifetime of your satellite in record time.

      Low Cost
      <div class="grid-item-tagline">Satellites shouldn't be expensive</div>

      <div class="grid-item">Our suite of algorithms and simulations costs less than a single GNC Engineer.
        With access to ultra high fidelity satellite simulations from day zero, we make component sizing and selection a piece of cake. Time is money, so
        we promise to save you both.

    <div class="grid-item-title"> <img src="dice.png" />Low risk
      <div class="grid-item-tagline">Mission critical means mission critical</div>

      <div class="grid-item">Our algorithms are designed to be
        flown on many satellites across the industry, meaning your software has flight heritage before you even launch. With a complete package of flight
        algorithms and simulations on demand, your GNC software can be developed in minutes, not years.
